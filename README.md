# Portfolio

In this updated version of my portfolio I went and changed little things that I either no longer liked or that needed to be spruced up. There was a bug with my mobile responsive burger menu that made the nav break from the header, so I fixed that. I orginally had these "copyright" footers at the bottom of each page and I thought they didn't look great so I took them out. After, I fixed a few minor styling details; I didn't really want to touch the styling because I am still very happy with the overall design of the site. For the additions to the "Projects" page I added Kuma (project 2) and Eat-Da-Burger becuase I thought it was a good representation of what I have learned from the backend. I also added the capability to click and download my resume from my contact page; something I wasn't able to figure out previously and that was recommneded I do by central grading.
I am overall a lot happier with this updated version of my portfolio.
