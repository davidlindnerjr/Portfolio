# Portfolio

My goal for this project was simply to one-up my previous portfolio. I wanted this version to be more mobile freindly, have dynamic and responsive elements, and have a better overall aesthetic. My biggest componenet of this version is the improved navbar; I wanted a navbar that would transform into a burger navbar for mobile responsiveness. I had a lot of trouble at first, but after looking at a few tutorials I was able to get it up and running.

The first version of my portfolio was super basic and had colors that didn't really stand out. I love sites that have a background image and that content that is somewhat opaque. So I wanted to recreate this for my new version. I love country side, red dirt road, backgrounds and themes so that is the image I decided to use as my background. I used a darker color that was opaque to display my content to the user; as well as a dark themed background that I think goes really well with the background image.

I learned a lot about responsiveness. I especially learned a lot about media queries. Media queries are just so useful and know that I know more about their use I think I can pull off a lot cooler/functional designs in the future.
